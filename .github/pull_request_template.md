## Pull Request template

Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

   a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/dashboard`.

   b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

   c. `npm test` doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first and commit.

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

   a. Your pull request MUST target the `main` branch on this repository.

   b. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

   c. Describe your changes.

   d. Put `#XXXX` in your comment to link the issue to your PR fixes.

IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.
